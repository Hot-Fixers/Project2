## Description
MyPantry is a web application that help users to track groceries. This application uses the Spoonacular api to retrieve recipes acoording to the grocery saved by the user. This app consists of login functionality which helps personalize the experience

## Challenges  
Our biggest challenges on this project were working with Lint and Travis to get checks to pass. We also had issues with Spoonacular api integration as it was always returning random results everytime. However, working together we were able to solve the issues as a team.

## Future Versions

* Integrate with delivery partners to help order groceries directrly from app.
* Create a CMS to manage users.
